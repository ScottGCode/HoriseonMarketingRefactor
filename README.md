# Horiseon Digital Marketing Website

## Description

I was motivated to refactor this code to make it more readable and user friendly. I started by removing any non-semantic HTML elements and replacing them with easier to read semantic elements. This makes the code much more readable and easier to work on. I also added alt attributes to the images to make the website more accessible. I leanred how to group together css styling to make it easier to read and work on. 

## Installation
